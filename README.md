### Premise and Rules: 
You are really into Shrek â€” so much so you are going to join other people who are also into the movie Shrek at a Shrek-themed rave. In this choose-your-own-adventure style game, you will lead a Shrek obsessive through a series of absurd choices preventing them from getting to the Shrek rave. Think *After Hours* meets *Shrek*, but a game.

**Rules**: Make decisions as if you really like Shrek and raves. 

Influenced by random early 2000s websites, Radiohead's early sites endless click-through mazes, or what if  Thomas Pynchon made a choose your own adventure in 2000(?).

### Next Steps
First, I'd like to rebuild this and make the logic less buggy while also able to render something more descriptive on the screen.

 Then, I'd like to make it an endless pit of nothingness, a maze that's so long, convoluted, and boring that the user gives up on its lengthy and pointless storyline.
 
Or maybe it's what motivates them to get to an ending?..I'd also like to add images.
